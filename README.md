   - Navigate to "🚀 Optimize" and click "Run Optimization"
   - View results in "📊 Results & Export"

### Manual Setup Workflow

#### Step 1: Add Inventory (📦 Inventory Setup)

Add your available lumber and board stock:
- Enter stock name (e.g., "Aus KD Pine 8'×7\"×3.5\"")
- Specify dimensions in millimeters (Length, Width, Thickness)
- Set quantity and cost per unit
- Track multiple lumber types

**Example:**
```
Name: Aus KD Pine 8'×7"×3.5"
Length: 2400 mm (8 feet)
Width: 175 mm (7 inches)
Thickness: 90 mm (3.5 inches)
Quantity: 20
Cost: $45.50
```

#### Step 2: Define Parts (🔧 Parts List)

Specify required cut parts:
- Part name and description
- Dimensions (mm)
- Quantity per product
- Total number of products
- Material type preference
- Rotation allowance (check for blocks/supports, uncheck for visible surfaces)
- Priority level (1-10, higher = assigned first)

**Example:**
```
Name: Top Deck Board (Plank)
Description: Top surface boards for pallet deck
Dimensions: 1200 × 100 × 22 mm
Quantity per product: 7
Total products: 10
Material: Pine
Allow rotation: No (visible surface)
Priority: 9/10
```

#### Step 3: Configure Parameters (⚙️ Cutting Parameters)

Set cutting constraints:
- **Kerf**: Saw blade gap (typically 2-4 mm)
- **Minimum Offcut**: Minimum size worth keeping (100-200 mm recommended)
- **Tolerance**: Allowable deviation (1-3 mm typical)
- **Grain Direction**: Enforce grain orientation if needed
- **Optimization Priority**: 
  - Maximize Efficiency (best material usage)
  - Minimize Cost (cheapest materials first)
  - Fastest Cut (simplest cuts)
- **Allow Resawing**: Cut stock lengthwise to reduce thickness
- **Allow Planing**: Remove material to match dimensions

#### Step 4: Run Optimization (🚀 Optimize)

- Review pre-optimization analysis
- Check material sufficiency
- Click "🚀 Run Optimization"
- Wait for algorithm to complete (typically < 1 second)

#### Step 5: View Results (📊 Results & Export)

### Algorithm Overview

The optimizer implements a **3D guillotine cutting algorithm** with:

1. **Part Sorting**: By priority and size
2. **Material Nesting**: Fit multiple parts on single stock
3. **Rotation Handling**: Try all valid orientations
4. **Grain Enforcement**: Respect material grain direction
5. **Offcut Tracking**: Identify reusable leftover pieces
6. **Tolerance Matching**: Accept near-matches within limits

**Optimization Flow:**
```
Input: Inventory + Parts + Parameters
  ↓
Sort parts by priority & size
  ↓
For each part:
  - Try existing cutting plans
  - If not fit, try new stock
  - Consider all rotations
  - Respect grain direction
  - Track offcuts
  ↓
Calculate statistics & efficiency
  ↓
Output: Cutting plans + Visualizations
```
